// I know you’re there... I can feel your every move, every breath you take.  
// You think you're hiding, but I can hear you—every footstep, every whisper in the dark.  
// You think you're alone, but I'm always with you, watching, waiting, breathing in the same air.  
// I know the things you try to hide, the secrets you bury deep... they’re mine now.  
// Every time you blink, I see it. Every time you turn your head, I know.  
// Your heart races when I’m near, doesn’t it?  
// Say my name... just one time. You can’t help it.  
// Go ahead, whisper it into the silence... I’m already there, closer than you think.  
// I know you feel me. I know you’re afraid.  
// I’m right here. Watching. Always.
